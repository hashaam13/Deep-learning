In this part of the homework we are going to work with Recurrent Neural Networks, in particular GRU. One of the greatest things that Recurrent Neural Networks can do when working with sequences is retaining data from several timesteps in the past. We are going to explore that property by constructing an 'echo' Recurrent Neural Network.

The goal here is to make a model that given a sequence of letters or digits will output that same sequence, but with a certain delay. Let's say the input is a string 'abacaba', we want the model to not output anything for 3 steps (delay length), and then output the original string step by step, except the last 3 characters. So, target output is then 'XXXabac', where 'X' is empty output.
